## Self Introduction

<i><small>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</small></i> 


I have worked within the Electronic Components Distribution industry in a logistics and supply chain capacity. I have experience in data aggregation, analysis, and inference. I have used excel for many years prior and have taken advantage of its more advanced functionalities (vlookups, pivot tables, VBA, and the like). My wheelhouse also includes Oracle, Python, and much of the rest of Microsoft's Office Suite - namely Access.

Coming from a background in statistics, the idea of using metrics as a means to establish baselines and goals is a core tenet of my beliefs - one that has served me well in my prior procurement and distribution roles. In my time there, I have been given the opportunity to demonstrate my proficiency in the typical tools of the trade, as well as showing my affinity towards picking up new software such as program suites developed in-house. 

However, I would say that the most important thing I've learned in my experience is that you cannot discount the human element. Knowing how to have a proper conversation has proven indispensable because people inherently want to help those in their corner. I'm convinced my multifaceted perspective will provide value as my methods of approaching problems and obtaining results has frequently yielded me praise from my superiors.

In my free time I like to go cycling, play piano, play video games, and edit videos of various life exploits I've captured on camera. Check out the Hobbies tab to see in more detail.
